        Hey, you seemed to have stumbled on my page! My name is Vamsi Gajjela;
        I am currently attending the University of Toronto for Computer Science.
        Programming has become something that I am passionate about since the
        first time I've tried it. You can even check out some of the
        side-projects I have done so far by clicking on the GitHub button.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you would like to check out my resume, you can view it right here on
        this site. You can contact me at vmgajjela@gmail.com if you have any
        questions, opportunities, or would like to give me any critique on my
        work. Any feedback is appreciated. I hope you have an excellent day :)
        thanks for stopping by.
    </p>
